The CIFAR-10 dataset stands as a beacon in machine learning and image classification. Consisting of 60,000 vivid color images with dimensions of 32x32 pixels, it encapsulates the vibrant spectrum of everyday objects and creatures, subdivided into 10 distinct classes:

Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
Each category is uniformly distributed, holding 6,000 images each. Of the entire dataset, 50,000 images are earmarked for training, leaving the remaining 10,000 for testing. Through this project, our mission is to craft and educate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that showcases adept classification proficiency on this diverse dataset.
